## Concepts

EPA announces the fuel economy of cars every year. 
We can compare the gas-consuming among different engine sizes, classes and manufacturers.
Comparison will be done by graphes discribed as below.

1. scatter plot of highway milage against engine displacement
2. boxplot by class
3. scatter plot of highway milage against engine displacement by manufacturers

Additionally we can choose years such as 1999, 2008 and both years.
